# Handwritten Digits Recognition using Logistic Regression
This project is a multiclass classification problem of recognizing handwritten digits using logistic regression. 
The objective of the project is to create a model that can accurately classify the digits from 0 to 9 based on the pixel values of the digit images.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST database of handwritten digits, which is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. 
The dataset consists of 1437 training images and 360 testing images. Each image is a 8x8 grayscale image of a handwritten digit from 0 to 9.

# Logistic Regression Model
Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification, but it can also be used for multiclass classification by extending it to 
handle more than two classes.

The logistic regression model was trained using the training set of the dataset, and the accuracy of the model was measured using the testing set. 

# Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97.2% on the testing set, which is a good result for this task. 
The model was able to correctly classify most of the digits from 0 to 9.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the use of logistic regression for multiclass classification in the context of handwritten digits recognition. 
The model achieved a good level of accuracy on the testing set, indicating that it can be used for real-world applications of recognizing handwritten digits.
